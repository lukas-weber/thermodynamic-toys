Thermodynamics toys
===================

These are a number of small educational simulations for undergraduate thermodynamics and statistical physics. They also show some computational basics like using numpy and interfacing between Python and C.

- `clt`: central limit theorem
- `pishot`: computing pi with random numbers, slow and fast implementation
- `ising`: your standard Ising Monte Carlo code.
- `piston`: oscillations around equilibrium (or not!) for a piston filled with gas
- `heating`: I… don’t even know. I think it is some time dependent solution of the Boltzmann equation. Is it correct and why did I do this?
